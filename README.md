# Ju-dg-st Eat

An API to help stop you ordering shit from discord. For now this will just be run via a chrome extension that checks the page that you're on. Mainly because the cunts won't give a proper api that isn't locked down behind being a resturaunt, basically.

For now the flow will be

### The Chrome App will:

- require a discord incoming webhook
- see you're on a confirmation page of Just Eat
- take the resturaunt name and how much you spent and send it to the API along with your webhook

### The API will:

- Take the details and send out a simple message explaining that you're a fucking dishonor on your family. And your cow.

### Optional:

- maybe subtle popups saying "Hey. HEY. I see you there"
