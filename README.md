# Ju-dg-st Eat

A webapp and API to help stop you ordering shit from discord. For now this will just be run via a chrome extension that checks the page that you're on. Mainly because the cunts won't give a proper api that isn't locked down behind being a resturaunt, basically.

Basically: Sign up on the webapp, put in details the api needs on your account, and use the browser extension. Any time you finish an order on just eat it'll see you're at the checkout complete section, pull the details it needs from the DOM and pass these along to the api to do it's thing and post to discord. Simple

### But Why Though?

... why not?

The api may store some demographics at some point. Maybe graphs to show the dates on the webapp, how much you've spent over x etc. Just silly little things.

### BUT REALLY. WHY THOUGH???

Because it's a dumb, fun learning experience.
